# OSA-SE-ProfileExample

Intended to be a quick working example of setting up a profile. (Semi unfilled out for some reason, it should have all the fields possible as a demonstration.)

# Making a Profile

Change the 000000 to the last 6 digits of the Hex ID of the actor. 

You can also see the exact path to make using the info panel when the actor is in a scene in game and looking at their persona directory.
